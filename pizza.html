    <p id="history">
        Foods similar to <span>pizza </span> have been made since the Neolithic Age.[23] Records of people adding other
        ingredients to
        bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
        soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on
        top of their battle shields[24][25] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and
        cheese.[26][27] An early reference to a <span>pizza</span> -like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen
        of the
        Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables
        (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped
        with cooked vegetables.

    <h2>Make Your Own Pizza</h2>
    <button>Pizza</button>

    <p id="make"><span>Pizza</span> is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been
        developed to
        overcome
        challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen
        and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen <span>pizzas</span> with raw ingredients and self-rising
        crusts.

        Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold
        unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic
        ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.

    <h3>Pizza in the USA</h3>

    <p id="usa">
        The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York City's Little Italy in 1905.[56] Common toppings for pizza
        in the United States include anchovies, ground beef, chicken, ham, mushrooms, olives, onions, peppers,
        pepperoni, pineapple, salami, sausage, spinach, steak, and tomatoes. Distinct regional types developed in the
        20th century, including Buffalo,[57] California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek, New Haven, New York, and St. Louis
        styles.[58] These regional variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled, and
        pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.
